🎮 Just Launched a Fun Mini Game Project! 🚀

I'm excited to share my latest project – a fully functionalRock-Paper-Scissors  built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

✅ Responsive UI
✅ Smooth gameplay
✅ Lightweight and fast
✅ Clean, beginner-friendly code

This project helped me strengthen my JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation skills, and I had a lot of fun creating the user experience. 💻✨
